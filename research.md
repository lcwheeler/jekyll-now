## Probing the basic principles of molecular evolution

Over the course of my undergraduate and graduate careers my interests have shifted progressivley more toward evolutionary biology. Evolution is the driving force that underlies all of the biological complexity and diversity on Earth. That a random process---governed solely by the physical rules of the universe---can give rise to amazingly complex, self-organizing, self-replicating systems is both beautiful and amazing. How is such a process possible? How are simple physical and chemical principles translated into the amazing complexity that we see in living systems? How does the architecture of individual living things constrain evolutionary outcomes? How do interactions within populations shape evolutionary processes? These are the types of questions that drive my passion for scientific research! 


### Working at the interface of biochemistry and evolutionary biology

My PhD research, in the Harms group at University of Oregon, has focused on understanding how the physical and chemical properties of proteins shape their evolution. I have focused on two main case studies as a way of probing several important principles in protein evolution; 1) The evolutionary divergence of metal binding sites in the S100 protein family as a model to understand the evolutionary lability of biochemical mechanisms, and 2) The evolution of binding specificity in the S100s as a model to study changes in specificity following gene duplication. My work has taken an interdisciplinary approach using a variety of tools from the fields of biochemistry, molecular biophysics, evolutionary biology, and molecular biology. Joining together experimental techniques such as phage display and next-generation sequencing with computational techniques like molecular phylogenetics, ancestral sequence reconstruction, and machine learning opens up the door to gaining deep insights into interesting evolutionary stories that would otherwise be inaccessible. Links to publications stemming from my PhD work can be found on the CV page.
