## A quest to understand the basic principles of evolution

Over the course of my undergraduate and graduate careers my interests have shifted progressivley more toward evolutionary biology. Evolution is the driving force that underlies all of the biological complexity and diversity on Earth. That a random process---governed solely by the physical rules of the universe---can give rise to amazingly complex, self-organizing, self-replicating systems is both beautiful and amazing. How is such a process possible? How are simple physical and chemical principles translated into the amazing complexity that we see in living systems? How does the architecture of individual living things constrain evolutionary outcomes? How do interactions within populations affect shape evolutionary processes? These are the types of questions that drive my passion for scientific research! 


### Working at the interface of biochemistry and evolutionary biology

My PhD research, in the Harms group at University of Oregon, has focused on understanding how the physical and chemical properties of proteins shape their evolution. I have focused on three main case studies as a way of probing several important principles in protein evolution; 1) The evolutionary divergence of metal binding sites as a model to understand the lability of an important biochemical feature, 2) The evolution of binding specificity in a family of signalling proteins as a model to study changes in specificity after gene duplication, and 3) the use of an experimental toy model to look for evidence of high-ordered epistatic interactions.
