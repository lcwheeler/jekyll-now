My name is Lucas C. Wheeler; usually I go by Luke. I'm a PhD candidate in biochemistry 
at the University of Oregon; studying how the molecular-biophysical properties of proteins
shape their evolution. My scientific interests are broad, ranging from biophysics to 
evolutionary biology. I also have a life-long love of herpetology, which I have pursued
as an amateur. Oustide of my scientific pursuits I am an avid hiker and outdoor aficionado. 
I enjoy camping, bicycling, unicycling, white-water rafting, and have a particular interest
in wildlife photography.

Wheeler LC, An-Lim S, Marqusee S, Harms MJ “The thermostability and specificity of ancient 
proteins.*” Curr Op Struct Biol. (LCW and SAL contributed equally to the work)

#### Outreach

As an undergraduate I regularly engaged in outreach activities designed to inspire scientific
interest in young children. A major problem I have encountered is the ability to both find 
and share resources for the development of teaching tools. Currently, I am working with one 
of my peers to develop an online tool for sharing teaching resources and ideas.
