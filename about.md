### Summary

My name is Lucas Wheeler; but socially I go by Luke. I'm a PhD candidate in biochemistry at the
University of Oregon; studying how the physicochemical properties of proteins
shape their evolution. My scientific interests are broad, ranging from biophysics to 
evolutionary biology. I also have a life-long love of herpetology, which I have pursued
as an amateur. Oustide of my scientific pursuits I am an avid hiker and outdoor aficionado. 
I enjoy camping, bicycling, unicycling, white-water rafting, and have a particular interest
in wildlife photography. 

### Bio

I grew up in Bend, Oregon; a lovely town in the rain shadow of the Cascade mountains. Growing up I spent a lot of time outside, hiking and camping with my family. I developed a keen interest in nature and the natural sciences. After moving to Montana at the age of seventeen I enrolled at Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. At MSU I earned a degree in biochemistry and started doing research in the fall my freshman year. My undergraduate research, in the lab of professor Trevor Douglas, was focused on creating biomimetic nanomaterials based on the encapsulation of peptides with various functions into the interior of virus-like particles. My undergraduate research was an extremely valuable educational experience. 

After graduating from Montana State, I moved back to my home state and enrolled in the biochemistry PhD program at the University of Oregon in Eugene. I did three laboratory rotations in my first year, but ultimately decided to join the newly-minted lab of new professor Mike Harms without rotating. As the first (and for a time the only) member of the Harms group, I had the unique and valuable experience of helping to set up a brand new research lab. Once we had the lab rolling, I began setting up several tangentially-related projects. I first studied the evolutionary lability of transition metal binding sites in the S100 protein family (publication below). Subsequently, I have coupled ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) and high-throughput experiments to measure evolutionary changes in several other important biochemical features of the S100 proteins. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of my PhD work, I have learned to implement a diverse range of approaches and techniques from biochemistry, biophysics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics in order to answer difficult questions about molecular evolution.

### Outreach activities

Growing up I had several opportunities to interact with professional scientists and learn about 
the scientific process in an educational environment. Those experiences shaped my view of science 
and inspired me to pursue a scientific career. I have engaged in outreach activities periodically 
since the beginning of my undergraduate education. I have a strong interest in continuing my involvement 
with outreach to the general public, because I believe that science is made stronger when the public 
is engaged.  One major problem I have encountered is the ability to both find 
and share resources for the development of teaching tools. Currently, I am working with one 
of my peers to develop an online repository for sharing teaching resources and ideas. 


### Student-driven interdisciplinary science

I have a strong interest in promoting policies of open science and broader collaboration among scientists. Particularly I believe that broadly interdisciplinary connections strengthen science as a whole. Sharing and discussion of ideas and advice amongst scientists from diverse backgrounds can be the basis for novel approaches. Toward this end I, along with some of my peers in the UO chemistry department, have created a student organization called the Quantitative Problem Solving and Research Communication Consortium. This organization holds biweekly meetings, each led by a single PhD student. The meetings give students from diverse fields such as biology, physics, and chemistry an opportunity to present their work and seek guidance from peers. Our meetings have been a useful venue for helping students to solve conceptually challenging research problems as well as to practice communication skills in a constructive environment.
