![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/me-with-bird.jpg "Gray Jay")

I received my PhD in biochemistry at the
University of Oregon in 2017; studying the evolutionary biochemistry of the S100 protein family. In January, 2018 I started a postdoc position with [Dr. Stacey Smith](https://www.colorado.edu/smithlab/) at University of Colorado Boulder. My current work is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of flower color. My scientific interests are broad, ranging from evolutionary biology to biophysics. I also have a life-long love of herpetology, which I have pursued
as an amateur. Oustide of my scientific pursuits I am an avid hiker and outdoor enthusiast. 
I enjoy camping, bicycling, unicycling, kayaking, photography, and many other activities. 

### Bio

I grew up in Bend, Oregon; in the rain shadow of the Cascade mountains. Growing up I spent a lot of time outside, hiking and camping with my family. I developed a keen interest in nature and the natural sciences. After moving to Montana at the age of sixteen I enrolled at Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. At MSU I earned a degree in biochemistry and started doing research in the fall my freshman year. My undergraduate research, in the lab of professor [Trevor Douglas](http://www.indiana.edu/~tdgroup/), was focused on creating biomimetic nanomaterials based on the encapsulation of peptides with various functions into the interior of virus-like particles. My undergraduate research was an extremely valuable educational experience. 

After graduating from Montana State, I moved back to my home state and enrolled in the biochemistry PhD program at the University of Oregon in Eugene. I did three laboratory rotations in my first year, but ultimately decided to join the newly-minted lab of new professor [Mike Harms](https://harmslab.uoregon.edu/) without even rotating! As the first (and for a time the only) member of the Harms group, I had the unique and valuable experience of helping to set up a brand new research lab. Once we had the lab rolling, I began setting up several tangentially-related projects. I first studied the evolutionary lability of transition metal binding sites in the S100 protein family. Subsequently, I coupled ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) and high-throughput experiments to measure evolutionary changes in several other important biochemical features of the S100s. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of my PhD work, I learned to implement a diverse range of approaches and techniques from biochemistry, biophysics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics in order to answer difficult questions about molecular evolution.

### Outreach and mentorship activities

Growing up, I participated many years in a row in the [Inventerprise](http://inventerprise.bendresearch.com/) contest hosted by Bend Research, Inc, which won me the opportunity to visit the research campus and interact with professional scientists. It was an invaluable chance to learn about the scientific process in an educational environment. Those experiences shaped my view of science and inspired me to pursue a scientific career. In an effort to inspire a love of science in others, I
have engaged in outreach activities periodically since the beginning of my undergraduate education. 
I was the secretary, and later the vice president, of the [Undergraduate Chemistry Society](http://www.chemistry.montana.edu/undergraduate/society.html) at Montana State. In graduate school I 
participated in the [Mad Duck Science Friday](https://sciencefriday.uoregon.edu/) series and several 
other outreach events in Eugene. Most recently I put together a Chemistry teaching lab for the [CU Upward Bound Program](https://www.colorado.edu/cuub/). I have a strong interest in continuing my involvement 
with outreach to the general public throughout my career. I believe that science is made stronger when the public 
is engaged that it is incredibly important to give young people in particular the chance to participate in 
scientific activities. 

I have been fortunate enough to have great mentors throughout all stages of my education. They have helped
me to develop important skills and given me opportunities for learning that I otherwise would not have had. 
I have done by best to pass along my experiences by mentoring others, including several summer undergraduate 
students. One of my proudest moments as a mentor was seeing my long time undergraduate mentee defend her honors
thesis with highest honors. These experiences have been a valuable learning opportunity for me as well and helped me to further appreciate the importance of good mentorship. As my career progresses, I seek to continue improving my mentoring skills and incorporate these into my work. 

### Interdisciplinary science

I have a strong interest in promoting policies of open science and broader collaboration among scientists. Particularly I believe that interdisciplinary connections strengthen science as a whole. I have found that outside perspectives are often  incredibly invaluable. Sharing and discussion of ideas and advice amongst scientists from diverse backgrounds can be the basis for novel approaches. Toward this end I, along with some of my peers in the UO chemistry department, created two clubs. 1) The highly entertaining and often educational [Beer and Theory Society](https://github.com/BeerTheorySociety), which focuses on learning theory from diverse fields whilst drinking beer; and 2) a student organization called the Quantitative Problem Solving and Research Communication Consortium. This organization held student-led meetings giving students from diverse fields such as biology, physics, and chemistry an opportunity to present their work and seek guidance from peers. These meetings were a useful venue for helping students to solve conceptually challenging research problems as well as to practice communication skills in a constructive environment. I was pleased to find a similar organization active upon my arrival at CU Boulder, the Quantitative Think Tank, which I have committed to participate in during my postdoc. Moving forward, I intend to continue seeking interdisciplinary collaborations and bringing together scientists from diverse backgrounds.
