My name is Lucas C. Wheeler; usually I go by Luke. I'm a PhD candidate in biochemistry 
at the University of Oregon; studying how the molecular-biophysical properties of proteins
shape their evolution. My scientific interests are broad, ranging from biophysics to 
evolutionary biology. I also have a life-long love of herpetology, which I have pursued
as an amateur. Oustide of my scientific pursuits I am an avid hiker and outdoor aficionado. 
I enjoy camping, bicycling, unicycling, white-water rafting, and have a particular interest
in wildlife photography.

#### Outreach

Growing up I had several opportunities to interact with professional scientists and learn about 
the scientific process in an educational environment. Those experiences shaped my view of science 
and inspired me to pursue a scientific career. I have engaged in outreach activities periodically 
since the beginning of my undergraduate education. I have a strong interest in continuing my involvement 
with outreach to the general public, because I believe that science is made stronger when the public 
is engaged. Additionally, I have a strong interest in promoting policies of open science and broader 
collaboration among scientists. One major problem I have encountered is the ability to both find 
and share resources for the development of teaching tools. Currently, I am working with one 
of my peers to develop an online repository for sharing teaching resources and ideas.
