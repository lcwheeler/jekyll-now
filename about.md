### Summary

In November, 2017 I defended my PhD dissertation in biochemistry at the
University of Oregon; studying the evolutionary biochemistry of the S100 protein family. In January, 2018 I started a postdoc position in the lab of Dr. Stacey Smith at University of Colorado Boulder. My work here is focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the evolution of flower color. My scientific interests are broad, ranging from evolutionary biology to biophysics. I also have a life-long love of herpetology, which I have pursued
as an amateur. Oustide of my scientific pursuits I am an avid hiker and outdoor enthusiast. 
I enjoy camping, bicycling, unicycling, kayaking, photography, and many other activities. 

### Bio

I grew up in Bend, Oregon; in the rain shadow of the Cascade mountains. Growing up I spent a lot of time outside, hiking and camping with my family. I developed a keen interest in nature and the natural sciences. After moving to Montana at the age of sixteen I enrolled at Montana State University in Bozeman, MT. At MSU I earned a degree in biochemistry and started doing research in the fall my freshman year. My undergraduate research, in the lab of professor Trevor Douglas, was focused on creating biomimetic nanomaterials based on the encapsulation of peptides with various functions into the interior of virus-like particles. My undergraduate research was an extremely valuable educational experience. 

After graduating from Montana State, I moved back to my home state and enrolled in the biochemistry PhD program at the University of Oregon in Eugene. I did three laboratory rotations in my first year, but ultimately decided to join the newly-minted lab of new professor Mike Harms without rotating. As the first (and for a time the only) member of the Harms group, I had the unique and valuable experience of helping to set up a brand new research lab. Once we had the lab rolling, I began setting up several tangentially-related projects. I first studied the evolutionary lability of transition metal binding sites in the S100 protein family. Subsequently, I coupled ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) and high-throughput experiments to measure evolutionary changes in several other important biochemical features of the S100s. Due to the interdisciplinary nature of my PhD work, I learned to implement a diverse range of approaches and techniques from biochemistry, biophysics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics in order to answer difficult questions about molecular evolution.

### Outreach and mentorship activities

Growing up I had several opportunities to interact with professional scientists and learn about 
the scientific process in an educational environment. Those experiences shaped my view of science 
and inspired me to pursue a scientific career. I have engaged in outreach activities periodically 
since the beginning of my undergraduate education. I have a strong interest in continuing my involvement 
with outreach to the general public, because I believe that science is made stronger when the public 
is engaged. 

I have been fortunate enough to have great mentors throughout all stages of my education. They have helped
me to develop important skills and given me opportunities for learning that I otherwise would not have had. 
I have done by best to pass along my experiences by mentoring others, including several summer undergraduate 
students. These experiences have been a valuable learning opportunity for me as well and helped me to further 
appreciate the importance of good mentorship. 

### Student-driven interdisciplinary science

I have a strong interest in promoting policies of open science and broader collaboration among scientists. Particularly I believe that broadly interdisciplinary connections strengthen science as a whole. Sharing and discussion of ideas and advice amongst scientists from diverse backgrounds can be the basis for novel approaches. Toward this end I, along with some of my peers in the UO chemistry department, created two clubs. 1) The highly entertaining and often educational Beer and Theory Society, which focused on learning theory from diverse fields whilst drinking beer; and 2) a student organization called the Quantitative Problem Solving and Research Communication Consortium. This organization held student-led meetings giving students from diverse fields such as biology, physics, and chemistry an opportunity to present their work and seek guidance from peers. These meetings were a useful venue for helping students to solve conceptually challenging research problems as well as to practice communication skills in a constructive environment. I was pleased to find a similar organization active upon my arrival at CU Boulder, the Quantitative Think Tank, which I have committed to participate in during my postdoc.
